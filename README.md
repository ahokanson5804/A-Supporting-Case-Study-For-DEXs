# Loopring - An Organizational Case Study


## A Decentralized Token Exchange Protocol


Loopring.org is an open protocol for the creation of decentralized exchanges (DEX's) that was established in late 2017 by its founders, Daniel Wan and Jay Zhou with Alex Wang and Matt Finestone coming to the company shortly after its inception to help with critical growth. Daniel Wang set out to create a zkRollup protocol that would lay the groundwork for anyone to create not only a web3 decentralized application (dApp), but an entire decentralized exchange (DEX) as well, based on the Ethereum protocol.


The company creates a system that helps people trade across different cryptocurrency exchanges. The company's protocol is used by many different exchanges to do things like match orders and settle trades. The zkRollup protocol helps protect users from risk and reduces the cost of trading at a margin currently unseen before.


The idea for Loopring came from a desire to create a more efficient and decentralized way to exchange cryptocurrencies. The zkRollup protocal cuts back on gas fees by a factor of 100-1000x (fluctuates based on asset type and high-load transation times) compared to Bitcoin, for example.


The company's primary means of funding came from their ICO (initial coin offering) in 2018 that generated approximately $45M for the organization. Loopring closed its last round of seed funding on January 1, 2019 for an undisclosed amount with 5 other VC firms (not all VC firms are listed). [1]


## Business Activities


Currently, Loopring is trying to solve the problem of high gas fees along with the slow transaction times associated with traditional cryptocurrency exchanges. Loopring's technology is intended for all to use, from the individual (retail) all the way to large institutions that want to trade/exchange digital assets in a more secure and efficient way than what any other current cryptocurrency technologies and exchanges can provide.


With Loopring's technology being fairly new, it's hard to gauge just how much of the crypto market it has taken hold of, but there are some underlying metrics that can be useful in estimating Loopring's recent disruption.


If we take a look at Looprings' fully diluted market cap using the following formula:
   
    FDMC = price x max supply // ($).2987 x ($)1,374,513,896 = $410,567,300.74


$410,567,300.74 alone puts Loopring in the top 100 tokens in the crypto ecosystem (86th currently). However, there are currently tens of thousands of Loopring wallets created (with 22K logged at the beginning of 2022) and a daily average trading volume of $50M. Loopring has it's own space in Reddit with just over 100K users, which puts Loopring's user engagement higher than it's FDMC, which sets it at the 86th rated token in the crypto-space. With this type of engagement, we can estimate that Loopring, along with its zkRollup technology, puts it well above the 86th largest crypto technology organization - token.[2]

Apart from the fact that Loopring's ecosystem has created everything it needs to compete with current CEX's (centralized exchanges) along with othe DEX's. Loopring has their own DEX with auto market maker capabilities along with its own wallet to hold both layer 1 and 2 cryptocurrencies; what sets it apart from everyone else is its zkRollup protocal.


The current technologies that Loopring is currently incorporating into their organization are:
* **Wallet** - A service or interface that grants users/traders access to their tokens and other digital assets (NFTs) with the safety of Loopring's encryption methods.


* **Consortium Liquidity Sharing Blockchain/Relay Mesh** - A relay is a node that is part of a network that shares liquidity with other nodes within the same network. The consortium blockchain is the first implementation that has near real-time order sharing (1-2 second blocks) and trims old history to allow for faster and more efficient downloads by new nodes.


* **Relays/Ring-Miners** - Relays are like nodes that act as a go-between for wallets and the relay-mesh. They keep track of public order books and trade history, and can also broadcast orders to other relays or relay-mesh nodes. Ringmining is a feature of relays that allows them to produce order rings by stitching together disparate orders. It's a computationally heavy process that is done completely off-chain.


* **Loopring Protocol Smart Contracts (LPSC)** - This protocol is a set of free, open-source smart contracts that act as a decentralized exchange (DEX) between different Ethereum-based tokens. The protocol incentivizes "ring-miners" (like bitcoin miners) to keep the order book up-to-date and to settle and transfer tokens on behalf of users.


* **Asset Tokenization Services (ATS)** -
> "An ATS is a bridge between assets that cannot be directly traded on Loopring. They are centralized services run by trustworthy organizations. Users deposit assets (real, fiat, or tokens from other chains) and get tokens issued, which can be redeemed for the deposit in the future. Loopring is not a cross-chain exchange protocol (until a suitable solution exists), but ATS enables the trading of ERC-20 tokens with physical assets as well as assets on other blockchains." [3]
## Landscape


In the financial world, you will find that Loopring falls into the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Some of the major trends and innovations in cryptocurrency over the last 5-10 years include the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs), the development of decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and the increasing use of stablecoins.



Some of the major players in the cryptocurrency domain are exchanges like Coinbase, Binance, and Kraken just to name a few.


## Results


By far, the most significant impact Loopring is making is achieving better performance in executed trades than other DEXs and CEXs by aggregating trades off-chain to avoid Ethereum network congestion.


Rollup technology that allows for such reduced gas-fees is the major metric that an organization such as Loopring uses to separate itself from traditional crypto exchanges and currencies; transaction per trade or converting to fiat (sending to and from traditional banks).


Taking Coinbase as an example, the platform charges .5%-1.0% per trade and a 1% flat fee to transfer funds to your fiat bank account. Currently, Loopring is offering .1% for trading fees and fiat bank transfers. According to l2fees.info Loopring gas fees are currently $0.01 for every $0.51 in gas fees on the Ethereum network. [4]


## Recommendations


Loopring is an open protocol for building decentralized exchanges. One of the biggest pivots they could make is to partner with another reputable source and build a decentralized exchange to take on the leading competitors such as Coinbase or Binance (which are CEXs). Secondly, if Loopring decides not to partner and build a DEX, then another recommendation to increase market cap would be to increase the bandwidth of the transactions allowed per second. Currenty, Loopring has the capability of processing up to 2000 transactions per second on its blockchain network, but not as good as ImmutableX's platform, which is currently running at approximately 9000 transactions per second. [5]


Following the path of ImmutableX again, it would benefit Loopring to secure any partnership with any major (or minor) web3 game developers. With its fast-paced transactions and super low gas fees makes Loopring the ultimate parter for in-game cryptocurrency transactions and NFT trading. Now what I have just described, is essentially ImmutableX's business model, but that organization is without the Loopring's protocal.


Loopring has currently teamed up with GameStop's NFT marketplace, which is a start, but ImmutableX has a much larger partnership with GameStop's marketplace in terms of web3 gaming. Taking into account everything listed above and using ImmutableX's current growth as a possible example model for Loopring, I believe they will be able to carve out their own large market cap within the crypto ecosystem in the next 5–10 years.
